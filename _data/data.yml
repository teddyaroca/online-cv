    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      My research interests are quite broad, but one of the main drivers of my research is that I find the nature of microorganisms very intriguing. 
      Under the umbrella of genomic epidemiology, I am interested in studying important pathogens of humans, animals, and plants.
      From the applied to the fundamental questions of ecology and evolution, speciation, lifestyle transitions, host ranges, recombination, and selection pressures, 
      I study the evolutionary history of pathogens in space and time, and its implications. 
      I have implemented a wide variety of tools in biological sciences to address interesting questions of fungal and bacterial biology, including non-parametric statistics, biostatistics, and classical statistics; taxonomy, phylogenetics, population genomics, and clasical epidemiology approaches.
      Most recently, I have used computational biology, bioinformatics, and quantitative biology to study patterns of recombination and evolution of human and animal bacterial pathogens.
      In the future, I want to contribute to larger efforts to elucidate the biogeography and historical context, ecological roles, and potential management strategies of important pathogens. 
        
education:
    - degree: Ph.D. in Plant Pathology
      university: Louisiana State University
      time: 2017 - 2021

        My PhD dissertation focussed on describing a novel fungal pathogen of soybean, causing a disease known as taproot decline (TRD), and elucidating the reasons leading to its appearance in the
        southern United States. Our findings included:
          - Pathogen described as a new species, <i>Xylaria necrophora</i>.
          - <i>Xylaria necrophora</i> origin, genetic diversity and reproductive strategies.
          - Secondary metabolites produced by <i>Xylaria necrophora</i> responsible for foliar symptoms associiated with TRD.
    - degree: M.Sc. in Plant Pathology
      university: Louisiana State University
      time: 2014 - 2016
      details: |
        I studied the influence of glyphosate on soybean nutrition and indirect effect on colonization by Cercospora cf. flagelaris, the pathogen associated with Cercospora leaf blight.
        Our findings included:
          - Zinc update is enhanced by glyphosate application.
          - More Zinc could influence pathogen colonization because Zinc acts as a transcriptional activator (Zinc finger).
          - No correlation between disease symptom ratings and fungal biomass detected with real-time PCR.
    - degree: B.Sc. in Agronomy
      university: Universidad Nacional de Agricultura (UNAG)
      time: 2008 - 2012
      details: |
        For my undergraduate thesis, I worked at the University of Georgia (UGA) to build a baseline of fungicide resistance in <i>Sclerotinia homoeocarpa</i>.
